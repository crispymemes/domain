# Self-Aware Domain

A revolutionary zero-cost domain concept where your website becomes a sentient character having an existential crisis in real-time.

## Features

- **Thought Categories**: Weighted selection from existential, cultural, business, and meta thoughts
- **Time-Based Moods**: Different personality based on time of day
- **Self-Editing**: Occasional backspacing and corrections mid-thought
- **Hidden Interactions**: Click counter, Konami code, copy detection
- **Easter Eggs**: Visitor tracking, idle detection, corporate mode toggle
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
